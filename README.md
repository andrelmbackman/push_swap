# push_swap

"This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for an
optimized data sorting."

- [ ] determine the range of each chunk, before each push: find the one that is closest
(with ra or rra)
- [ ] make a function that pushes chunks, that takes an int count argument to chose
how many chunks (this way experimenting will be a lot easier)- [ ] when pushing back chunks, check if you can save moves by not rotating, and instead pushing and doing ss
- [ ] Every check before pushing to b: check if SS, RR or RRR is useful.


- [ ] create algorithm
- [ ] protect against seg faults when doing -0, +1..
- [ ] Make radix sort but before the loop, check how many fit the thing, then stop when they have all been pushed??
- [ ] Make radix sort work with negative numbers (make them in order and positive), only call if n < some large number and k < ?

- [x] Execute moves (dispatch table? Combine functions?)
- [x] Make a circular doubly linked list? Faster to reach the last node.
- [x] Fix free_stacks to work for circular doubly linked list DONE?
- [x] Fix check_stacks to function with CDLL

- make a script that uses curl to get 500 random ints
