# push_swap

"This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for an
optimized data sorting."

BEST:
500: 6084 - 7236
100: 646 - 852

- [ ] make two_chunks work with any number of ints
(- [ ] function that checks the general visinity, would it be beneficial to keep
doing rb or rrb?)
- [x] push the necessary ones when rotating
- [ ] if not using dst_prev: deletet it from header and get_destined
- [x] determine the range of each chunk, before each push: find the one that is closest
(with ra or rra)
- [x] make a function that pushes chunks, that takes an int count argument to chose
how many chunks (this way experimenting will be a lot easier)- [ ] when pushing back chunks, check if you can save moves by not rotating, and instead pushing and doing ss
- [ ] Every check before pushing to b: check if SS, RR or RRR is useful.

- [ ] protect from a huge number of ints?
- [ ] protect against seg faults when doing -0, +1..

- [ ] Make radix sort but before the loop, check how many fit the thing, then stop when they have all been pushed??
- [ ] Make radix sort work with negative numbers (make them in order and positive), only call if n < some large number and k < ?

- make a script that uses curl to get 500 random ints
