# push_swap

"This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for an
optimized data sorting."

[DESCRIBE LEARNINGS, MISTAKES]
- radix sort was not efficient, too many operations following the rules of the project, pushing to stack b and then stack a a lot of times.
- making 10 chunks and then looking for the biggest/smallest required quite a few moves to order them like that in b_stack and a lot of rotations to push them back in the right order to a_stack
