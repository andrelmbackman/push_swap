# push_swap

"This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for an
optimized data sorting."

- [] Provide tests

- [] unused variables


- [] MAKEFILE: remove -g flag from checker, push_swap, libft and ft_printf, compile so that just writing #include "push_swap.h" works



BEST:

100: 583 - 655
500: 5018 - 5445




PA: (PB: longest increasing subsequence?)
PA: look for subchunks instead of largest to smallest, this will grant easier search,
more use of RR, RRR, SS? - look for (10) numbers? push, get them in order, rotate out
of the way to fit them in
- Push them back in general order, they will not be in perfect order until the
whole subchunk is pushed back to A.

- [ ] protect from a huge number of ints?
