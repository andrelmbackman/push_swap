# push_swap

"This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for an
optimized data sorting."

- [ ] Execute moves (dispatch table? Combine functions?)
- [ ] Make a circular doubly linked list? Faster to reach the last node.
- [ ] Malloc the b_stack list
- [x] Fix free_stacks to work for circular doubly linked list DONE?
- [ ] Fix check_stacks to function with CDLL
